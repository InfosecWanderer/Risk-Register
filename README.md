# Risk Register

## Description
This Risk Register provides a comprehensive assessment of potential risks faced by a bank, located in a coastal area characterized by low crime rates. It serves to identify vulnerabilities that could impact the bank's operations, data security, and financial integrity. The bank employs 100 on-premise staff and 20 remote workers, serving a customer base of 2,000 individual accounts and 200 commercial accounts. Collaborations with a professional sports team and ten local businesses bolster its marketing efforts. Adherence to stringent financial regulations is critical for ensuring the security of data and funds.

### Risk Evaluation Criteria
- **Likelihood (1-3):** 
  - 1: Low likelihood
  - 2: Moderate likelihood
  - 3: High likelihood
- **Severity (1-3):** 
  - 1: Low severity
  - 2: Moderate severity

## Key Insights
- **Internal Threats:** The bank’s sizable workforce, alongside marketing partnerships, increases susceptibility to internal threats such as human error and malicious insider actions.
- **External Threats:** Vulnerabilities in data encryption and physical security can be exploited by external attackers, leading to potential financial losses and reputational harm.

## Summary
The Risk Register identifies critical vulnerabilities that could affect the bank’s operations and data security. High-priority risks, particularly the potential for a database leak and poor data encryption, require immediate attention and the implementation of robust mitigation strategies. Regular audits, employee training, and enhancements to both physical and cybersecurity measures are essential to safeguarding the bank’s assets, ensuring compliance with financial regulations, and maintaining customer trust.

## Recommendations
1. **Employee Training:** Implement mandatory, regular security training for all employees, focusing on phishing and social engineering tactics.
2. **Data Encryption:** Upgrade encryption methods for sensitive data storage and transmission, ensuring compliance with industry standards.
3. **Access Controls:** Strengthen access controls to sensitive data and systems, employing the principle of least privilege.
4. **Incident Response Plan:** Develop a comprehensive incident response plan, outlining steps to take in the event of a security breach.
5. **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular risk assessments and audits to ensure that mitigation strategies are effective and up to date.

By proactively addressing these risks, the bank can significantly enhance its security posture, mitigate risks associated with data breaches, and improve compliance with regulatory requirements.
